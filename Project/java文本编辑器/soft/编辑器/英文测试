A fox and a goat
     An unlucky fox fell into a well, It was quite deep, so he could not get out by himself. 
     A goat came. He asked the fox:¡±what are you doing? The fox said : "There will  be no water, so I jumped down to get some water. Why don¡¯t you jump down, too?" 
     The goat  jumped into the well. 
     But the fox jumped on the goat¡¯s back and out of the well. "Good-bye, friend," said the fox. "Remember next time don¡¯t trust the advice of a man in difficulties.
